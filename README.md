# Parse Excel sheet

The code is not finished as users cannot yet be saved to clerk due to `phone_number` property issues. But the file has been parsed and the code runs for that purpose.

The `Declarations` result can be found in `declarations.json` after running the script, while the filing data can will be saved to `filingData.json`. This will be changed as persistence of data to the database is the goal.

## Run

```bash
./run.sh
```
